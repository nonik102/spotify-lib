# spotify-lib
library of functions for accessing the spotify api

## Secrets
Spotify requires api credentials. These should be stored in a file at the following path: `/home/$USER/.tokens/spotify_api.tok`

The format should be as follows:
```shell
client_id
secret
```

Please note that this repo is very much WIP and in active development. When in a satisfactory state, releases will be tagged.
